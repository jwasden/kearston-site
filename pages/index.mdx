# Kearston Galindo

Hello, I'm Kearston Galindo, a passionate Family Support Therapist juggling the roles of a loving parent and a dedicated educator. I find joy in guiding my two children through the exciting journey of homeschooling, all while bringing my expertise as a Therapeutic Interventionist and Autism Educational Assistant to the table.

My educational background includes a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from BYU, providing me with a solid foundation for understanding the intricacies of the human mind. Additionally, I hold a Master's degree in Infant Mental Health, further enriching my ability to support and nurture the emotional well-being of young minds.

It is crafted using **Next.js** along with the [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) library, enabling a seamless blend of technology and content creation.
